          <h3>What is responsive web design?</h3>

          <p>Much has been made about so-called Responsive Web Design (RWD).  The term was first coined by Ethan Marcotte in his book by the same name, and refers to the practice of designing and building web pages that "respond" to the device you are viewing them on by scaling their appearance, navigation, and sometimes content based on screen size.  In Ethan's words,</p>

          <blockquote>"a design that can adapt to the constraints of the browser window or device that renders it, creating a design that almost responds to the user's needs."</blockquote>

          <p>Five years ago, this idea was just starting to gain traction, as users were getting more and more frustrated by "mobile" versions of websites getting served to them on their phones - stripped of most content and pre-formatted for one screen size, regardless of device.  As more device sizes proliferated, a new solution outside of building mobile-specific websites for each device was needed, and that's where the movement of Responsive Web Design comes in.</p>
            
          <p>With a website designed using RWD principles, users would no longer be served a "mobile" version of a website, because such a thing would not exist.  Instead, a traditional website would scale to fit on a mobile device in such a way as to still make the web page usable, and still give a fully fleshed out user experience. Ethan maintains that there are three ingredients to RWD:</p>
	     <ul>
            <li>A grid-style layout that is flexible - in that it can scale based on the size of the screen.</li>
            <li>Images and Media that are also flexible and able to scale.</li>
            <li>Media queries - a way (through CSS) for a website to tell the size device you are viewing it on.</li>
          </ul>
        <br>
